# Project Rules

- Treat `config/taxonomy.yaml` as product code. Every classification must store the taxonomy version used.
- Keep client product maps local. Do not send product-map or client-specific facts to LLM providers in the MVP foundation.
- Public regulator publication text may be classified by the AI seam once a provider is explicitly configured.
- Product-map impact scoring is deterministic and versioned in `config/scoring-rules.yaml`.
- Email, Slack, Teams, HubSpot, publishing, and outreach paths must stay draft-only unless a reviewed action explicitly sends them.
- Prefer fixture-backed ingestion tests before changing live adapter parsing.
- Agentic work is default-deny. Agents may draft findings, classifications and alert previews, but they may not send messages, approve review items, mutate product maps, change source status or bypass alert proof packets.
- Demo publications and product maps must stay synthetic or public-source only.
